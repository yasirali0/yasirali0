### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- I'm Yasir Ali. I'm from Pakistan but currently residing in South Korea for my Masters degree.

- ðŸ‘€ I've been interested in programming since the very first time I took C++ course in my undergraduate degree.
- After that, I have written codes in other programming languages at some basic level, such as JavaScript (especially React framework), MATLAB, and C.
- Now, I mostly code in Python because it is more suitable for AI, machine learning, and deep learning.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as a graduate researcher at ISML Lab, Gachon University. My research topic is Federated Learning and more specifically the detection of poisoning attacks in federated learning.

- ðŸŒ± I am very good and fast at learning programming languages, but not so much at learning natural languages. Nowadays, I'm trying to learn Korean.
