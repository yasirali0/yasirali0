<summary><h3>‚ñ∂Ô∏è About Me</h3></summary>

- üíº Currently, I am working as an AI Developer at [A-Tech Solution Co., Ltd.](https://www.atechsolution.co.kr/wp/?lang=en).
  - This role is related to the development of LLM-based applications.
- üíº Previously, I worked as an AI Developer intern at [HAMA Lab Co., Ltd.](https://hamalab.io/) for two months.
  - My focus was on video recommendation systems where I performed tasks ranging from data analysis, deep learning-based model development and its dockerization up to Flask-based API development.
- üëã I did my Masters degree in Computer Engineering at [Gachon University](https://www.gachon.ac.kr/kor/index.do) and worked as a Graduate Research Assistant at [ISML Lab](https://ai-security.github.io/professor_main_e.htm), Gachon University.
- üî≠ My area of research in master's was federated learning, and my research topic was detection of poisoning attacks in federated learning.
- üíª I've been interested in programming since the very first time I took C++ course in my undergraduate degree.
  - I have programmed in various languages such as C++, C, JavaScript, and MATLAB, at a basic level.
  - I am proficient in **Python** and use it for research and development in machine learning and deep learning.

  - Research on Federated Learning
    - Conducted research in federated learning, focusing on the detection of poisoning attacks within the federated learning paradigm
    - Developed a federated learning framework using Python, PyTorch, and threading
    - Implemented deep learning models such as AlexNet, VGG16, and ResNet18 as the base models for the federated learning environment, and evaluated them on datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100
    - Simulated poisoning attacks and analyzed their impact on the accuracy of federated learning
    - Integrated state-of-the-art poisoning attack defense methods into the codebase for benchmarking purposes
    - Proposed a novel defense method that outperformed the state-of-the-art in terms of poisoning attack detection accuracy
 
  - Research on Tracing Attackers Over Overlay Networks
    - Collaborated with a colleague on this research project aimed at reducing the execution time and memory consumption of deep learning-based correlation attacks against Tor networks
    - Conducted a thorough survey on deanonymization attacks targeting the Tor overlay network, with a specific focus on deep learning-based correlation attacks
    - Performed an in-depth analysis of the prominent deep learning-based correlation attack, "DeepCoFFEA" identifying two critical issues, high memory consumption and execution time
    - Successfully mitigated memory consumption challenge, reducing consumption from 133GB to 70GB through effective memory deallocation and proactive garbage collection strategies
    - Achieved a seven times reduction in execution time by leveraging GPU processing, facilitated by PyCUDA library.
    - Co-authored a <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10309127/" target="_blank">research article</a> in IEEE Access journal, outlining the findings and implemented solutions

- **Intern** | February 2021 - April 2021 | National Center of Artificial Intelligence at UET Peshawar, Pakistan
  - Landslide Monitoring and Alert System
    - Collected landslide videos to form a dataset for input into deep learning models
    - Segmented and annotated videos into pre-landslide, landslide, and post-landslide phases by utilizing a custom Python script
