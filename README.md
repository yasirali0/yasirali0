<summary><h3>▶️ About Me</h3></summary>

- 👋 I am a Graduate Research Assistant at [ISML Lab, Gachon University](https://ai-security.github.io/professor_main_e.htm), and doing my Masters degree in Computer Engineering at [Gachon University](https://www.gachon.ac.kr/kor/index.do).
- 🔭 My area of research is federated learning, and my research topic is detection of poisoning attacks in federated learning.
- 👀 I've been interested in programming since the very first time I took C++ course in my undergraduate degree.
  - After that, I have written codes in other programming languages at some basic level, such as JavaScript, MATLAB, and C.
  - Now, I mostly code in **Python** because it is more suitable for research and development in AI, machine learning, and deep learning.

<summary><h3>▶️ Research Experience</h3></summary>

- **Graduate Research Assistant** | March 2022 - Present | Information Security & Machine Learning Lab, Gachon University, South Korea
  - Research on Federated Learning
    - Developed a federated learning framework using Python, PyTorch, and threading
    - Implemented and evaluated the performance of various deep learning models e.g., AlexNet, VGG16, and ResNet18 within my federated learning codebase
    - Implemented and analyzed the impact of poisoning attacks on the performance of federated learning
    - Integrated state-of-the-art poisoning attack defense methods into the codebase for benchmarking purposes
    - Proposed a novel defense method that outperformed the state-of-the-art in terms of poisoning attack detection accuracy
    - Authored a research article currently under review in an IEEE journal
    - Currently surveying defense methods against poisoning attacks in asynchronous federated learning
 
  - Research on Tracing Attackers Over Overlay Networks
    - Conducted a thorough survey on deanonymization attacks targeting the Tor overlay network, with a specific focus on deep learning-based correlation attacks
    - Performed an in-depth analysis of the prominent deep learning-based correlation attack, <a href="https://github.com/traffic-analysis/deepcoffea/" target="_blank">DeepCoFFEA</a> identifying critical issues such as high memory consumption and correlation time
    - Successfully mitigated memory-related challenges, reducing consumption from 133GB to 70GB through effective memory deallocation and proactive garbage collection strategies
    - Achieved a seven times reduction in correlation time by leveraging GPU processing, facilitated by PyCUDA library.
    - Published a <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10309127/" target="_blank">research article</a> in IEEE Access journal, outlining the findings and implemented solutions

- **Intern** | February 2021 - April 2021 | National Center of Artificial Intelligence at UET Peshawar, Pakistan
  - Contributed to the Landslide Monitoring and Alert System Project
  - Collected landslide videos to form a dataset for input into deep learning models
  - Segmented and annotated videos into pre-landslide, landslide, and post-landslide phases by utilizing a custom Python script
